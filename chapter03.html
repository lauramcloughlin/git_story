<h2>The Veg</h2>
<h3>Carrots</h3>
<p> Cover the pan and cook over medium-low heat for 7 to 8 minutes, until the carrots are just cooked through.
    Add the butter and continue to cook for another minute, until the water evaporates and the carrots are coated
    with butter. Off the heat, toss with a little chopped parsley. Sprinkle with salt and pepper and serve.</p>
<h3>Broccoli</h3>
<p>Bring the water to a simmer over medium-high heat. Add the broccoli florets and cover. Steam for 4 to 5 minutes,
    until soft. </p>
<h3> Carrots and parsnips </h3>
<p> Bring a large pot of salted water to the boil. Add carrots, cover partially, and simmer 5 minutes. Add parsnips,
    and cover partially. Return vegetables to saucepan, and stir over medium heat until any excess water evaporates.
    Mash until most lumps are removed. </p>
