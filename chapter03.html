<h1>The Traditional Sunday Dinner</h1>

<h2>The Veg</h2>
<h3>Carrots</h3>
<p> Cover the pan and cook over medium-low heat for 7 to 8 minutes, until the carrots are just cooked through.
    Add the butter and continue to cook for another minute, until the water evaporates and the carrots are coated
    with butter. Off the heat, toss with a little chopped parsley. Sprinkle with salt and pepper and serve.</p>
<h3>Broccoli</h3>
<p>Bring the water to a simmer over medium-high heat. Add the broccoli florets and cover. Steam for 4 to 5 minutes,
    until soft. </p>
<h3> Carrots and parsnips </h3>
<p> Bring a large pot of salted water to the boil. Add carrots, cover partially, and simmer 5 minutes. Add parsnips,
    and cover partially. Return vegetables to saucepan, and stir over medium heat until any excess water evaporates.
    Mash until most lumps are removed. </p>

<h3>Cauliflower Cheese</h3>
<p><strong>Ingredients  </strong>- 1 medium head cauliflower, 400ml milk, 100g mature grated cheddar cheese, 40g butter, 40g plain flour, 1 tsp English mustard.</p>


<p><strong>Method  </strong>- Preheat the oven to 190C/375F.Break the cauliflower up into large florets, wash these thoroughly and place in a large saucepan covering with water.
Bring to the boil and cook for about 3-5 minutes, until the cauliflower is tender, but still quite firm. Drain florets.
To make the Cheese sauce, melt the butter in a pan and stir in the flour. Cook over a low heat for one minute.
Remove the pan from the heat and add the milk gradually, a little at a time, stirring well.
Return the pan to a medium heat and bring the mixture to the boil, stir constantly. Allow to simmer for two minutes and
then remove from the heat.
Stir in the mustard and two thirds of the cheese. Arrange the cauliflower in a baking dish, pour over the sauce, ensuring the cauliflower is completely covered.
Scatter over the remaining cheese over the cauliflower and bake in the oven for about 25 minutes and until golden-brown. </p>
