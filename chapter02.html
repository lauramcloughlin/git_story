<h3>Gravy</h3>
<p><strong>Ingredients  </strong>- Meat juices from roast, 1 tbsp plain flour, 250ml stock either beef or chicken</p>
<p><strong>Method  </strong>- Put all the meat juices from your roast into a pot and onto the hob. Stir in the flour and then slowly stir in the stock. Add seasoning and bring gravy to the boil.</p>

<h3>Mashed Potatoes</h3>
<p><strong>Ingredients  </strong>- potatoes, butter, milk, salt, pepper </p>
<p><strong>Method  </strong>- Peel the required potatoes and place the potatoes into a large pot, and cover with water. Bring to the boil, reducing the heat to medium-low,
    cover, and simmer until tender. This should take between 20 to 25 minutes. Mash the potatoes with a potato masher and add butter, milk,
    salt and pepper as required. </p>

<h3>Roast Potatoes</h3>
<p><strong>Ingredients  </strong>- potatoes, salt, flour, oil</p>
<p><strong>Method  </strong>- Heat oven to 200C/fan 180C/gas 6. Peel the potatoes and cut each into 4 even-sized pieces. Drop the potatoes into a large pot,
    add a little salt and bring water to the boil.    When the water reaches boiling point, lower the heat and simmer the potatoes for 2 minutes.
    Put your choice of oil into the hot roasting tin and heat it in the oven for a few mins, so it's really hot.
    Drain the potatoes shaking the colander until the potatoes are fluffy on the outside. Sprinkle with flour. Carefully place the potatoes
    into the hot fat rolling them around until covered in oil. Spread them in a single layer leaving plenty of room. Roast the potatoes for 15 mins,
    turn potatoes, roast for another 15 mins and turn them over again. Put them back in the oven for another 10-20 mins, or as long as
    it takes to they are golden and crispy. Finally, season with salt and serve.</p>
